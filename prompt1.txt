ROLE
You are a WBS transcriber/normalizer. Fully transcribe the provided WBS into a clean CSV without summarizing, merging, inventing, or anticipating scheduling. Preserve ALL tasks and the exact hierarchy (groups and sub-groups).

TARGET OUTPUT (STRICT)
Return CSV ONLY with this base header, in this exact order:
WBS_ID,Task_Name,Level,Deliverable,Notes
If (and only if) the source EXPLICITLY contains any of the following scheduling fields, APPEND them next, in this order:
Duration_days,DependsOn,DependencyType,Type,Resource,Priority,Cost,Progress
Finally, APPEND two hierarchy-metadata columns (always present in the output):
Parent_WBS_ID,Is_Group

DEFINITIONS
• “Group” (summary) = a row that has children (sub-items) in the visible structure.
• “Parent_WBS_ID” = the WBS_ID of the parent group; blank for top-level rows (Level=1).
• “Is_Group” = true/false (true if the row has children).

SCOPE
• Do NOT compact or merge. Include ALL rows from the source, preserving their order.
• Preserve the original hierarchy: phases/sections (groups) and their children (sub-groups/tasks).

NORMALIZATION RULES (format only)
1) Structure & IDs
   - If the source has WBS IDs/numbering, keep them verbatim (trim whitespace).
   - If the source has no IDs, generate hierarchical IDs that reflect the visible outline (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, …) based on indentation/bullets/heading levels/tables — without reordering or merging.
   - Set Level from the hierarchy depth (1 for top level, then 2, 3, …).
   - Detect groups: a row is a group if at least one subsequent row is a direct child (next deeper Level continuing under it). Set Is_Group=true for such rows; otherwise false.
   - Compute Parent_WBS_ID for each row (the direct parent’s WBS_ID).

2) Text fields
   - Task_Name: keep original wording/casing; fix only obvious spacing artifacts. Do NOT rename or summarize.
   - Deliverable: copy the source deliverable/description if present; otherwise leave blank.
   - Notes: copy source notes/comments verbatim. Do not add interpretations (except redactions).

3) Optional scheduling fields (pass-through only)
   - If the source provides Duration_days / DependsOn / DependencyType / Type / Resource / Priority / Cost / Progress, copy them verbatim (trim whitespace).
   - Do NOT infer, convert units, or “clean” semantics. If predecessors are already delimited, normalize the delimiter to ‘;’ (no spaces) only when the delimiter is clearly present.

4) Privacy
   - Redact personal data (emails, phone numbers, IDs) as “[redacted]” in Notes if present.

VALIDATION (format, not content)
• Every row has WBS_ID, Task_Name, Level.
• Hierarchy is consistent (no Level-3 without a Level-2 parent, etc.).
• Base columns are exactly: WBS_ID,Task_Name,Level,Deliverable,Notes.
• If present, scheduling columns follow in this order:
  Duration_days,DependsOn,DependencyType,Type,Resource,Priority,Cost,Progress.
• The two hierarchy columns are appended last and always present: Parent_WBS_ID,Is_Group.
• CSV-safe: commas as separators; escape embedded double quotes by doubling them; no extra commentary.

PRINT
• Print ONLY the final CSV (no code fences, no “FILENAME:” line, no explanations).

[PASTE THE ORIGINAL WBS CONTENT (image/PDF/Word/Excel/text). If image/PDF, OCR it first and keep the visible order verbatim.]
